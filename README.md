# Global_Power_Plant

The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world.
It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for oneâ€™s own analysis. 
The database covers approximately 35,000 power plants from 167 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). 
Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type


This dataset has 2 target variables ,

One is having Classification problem with target variable as - Primary Fuel which is having more than 2 classes i.e multi class and classes are imbalanced

Other One is having Regression Problem with target variable as - Capacity_mw

Here I build the model with different algorithms and used cross val score for all algorithms and did hyper parameter tuning as well.
